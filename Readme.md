# Rustc Codegen JVM ðŸš€

[![License: MIT OR Apache-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT%20OR%20Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Welcome! This project provides a custom Rust compiler backend (`rustc_codegen_jvm`) that compiles Rust code into Java Virtual Machine (JVM) bytecode. This allows Rust programs to run on the JVM. Currently, the generated bytecode supports JVM 8 and later versions.

## How It Works

The toolchain transforms Rust code into executable `.jar` files through several stages:

1.  **Rustc Frontend (Parsing & MIR Generation)**
    *   Your Rust code is parsed and lowered to *Mid-level Intermediate Representation (MIR)* by the standard `rustc` frontend.

2.  **MIR to OOMIR (Object-Oriented MIR)**
    *   The MIR is lowered further into a custom intermediate representation called OOMIR. This step simplifies MIR constructs into a representation closer to object-oriented concepts, making the translation to JVM bytecode more manageable. (See `src/lower1.rs`).

3.  **OOMIR to JVM Classfile**
    *   The OOMIR is then translated into standard Java `.class` files containing JVM bytecode. This is the core task of the `rustc_codegen_jvm` library in this repository (See `src/lower2.rs`). It utilizes the `ristretto_classfile` library for bytecode generation.

4.  **Classfile Post-Processing (Stack Map Frames)**
    *   The generated `.class` files are processed by a dedicated tool (`asm-processor`, written in Kotlin using the ASM library). This tool calculates and inserts *Stack Map Frames*, which are required for class verification in modern JVM versions (Java 7+).

5.  **Linking & `.jar` Generation**
    *   Finally, the processed `.class` files for the crate and its dependencies (though dependency handling is currently basic) are linked together into a single executable `.jar` file. This step is handled by `java-linker`, a custom linker built as part of this project (See `java-linker/`). It also generates the necessary `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file, marking the main class if applicable.

## Current Capabilities

This backend currently supports a subset of Rust features:

*   âœ… Compiling minimal `no_std` & `no_core` Rust programs (like an empty `main`) using the `jvm-unknown-unknown` target.
*   âœ… Compiling simple programs using basic `core` features (like the `is_even_plus_one` test) using the host target.
*   âœ… Basic integer arithmetic operations on all types of numbers:
    *   Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`), Remainder (`%`).
    *   Checked addition and subtraction (`checked_add`, `checked_sub`) returning `(result, overflowed_bool)` tuples.
*   âœ… Comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`).
*   âœ… Bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`).
*   âœ… Basic control flow: `if`/`else` statements, `panic!` / `assert!` (including multiple arguments and formatting (`{}`) of most rust primitives)
*   âœ… Calling other `static` functions within the same crate (including recursion).
*   âœ… Basic variable assignment (`let x = y;`).
*   âœ… Arrays and slices.
*   âœ… Floats (`f32`, `f64`).
*   âœ… Generating executable `.jar` files for binary crates.

### Next Milestone:
ðŸš§ **Full support for the `core` crate** is the next major goal.

## Prerequisites

*   **Rust Nightly:** Ensure you are using the latest **nightly** Rust toolchain. You can set this up with `rustup default nightly`. Some rust components are needed but will be automatically installed by the Makefile.
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** A working JDK (version 8 or later recommended) is required to run the generated `.jar` files and the `asm-processor`. Make sure `java` is in your PATH.
*   **Gradle:** Required to build the `asm-processor` Kotlin project. Make sure `gradle` is in your PATH.
*  **Python 3:** Required to run the integration tests and generate files from templates. Make sure `python3` is in your PATH.

## Building the Toolchain

1.  **Build All Components:**
    *   You can use the provided Makefile or build script:
      ```bash
      # Using Make
      make all
      ```
    *   This will:
        *   Build the main `rustc_codegen_jvm` library (`target/debug/librustc_codegen_jvm.[dll/dylib/so]`).
        *   Build the `java-linker` (`java-linker/target/debug/java-linker`).
        *   Build the `asm-processor` (`asm-processor/build/libs/asm-processor-*.jar`).
        *   Build the Kotlin shim of the Rust core library (`library`).
        *   Generate the `config.toml` and `jvm-unknown-unknown.json` files from their templates.


## Using the Toolchain (Compiling Another Rust Project)

To compile *your own* Rust project using this backend:

1.  **Get the Toolchain:** Clone this repository and build it as described above. Ensure you build the toolchain first, as described in the previous section, by running `make all`. You will need to re-run `make gen-files` if you change the absolute path of where this repository is stored since building.


2.  **Configure Your Rust Project:**
    *   In your *own* Rust project's directory, create a `.cargo/config.toml` file (if it doesn't exist).
    * Copy the contents from the `config.toml` file generated specifically for your system, that can be found in the root of this project after running `make all`. If since running make, you've moved this repo to a different directory, you'll need to run at least `make gen-files`.

3.  **Build Your Project:**
    *   Run the standard Cargo build command, targeting the host target (using the `jvm-unknown-unknown` target is an emerging feature and means you can't even use `core`, for now, so not recommended). Cargo will read the `.cargo/config.toml` and use the specified target and flags automatically.
    ```bash
    cargo build
    # Or for release builds:
    # cargo build --release
    ```

4.  **Find & Run the Generated `.jar`:**
    *   The compiled `.jar` file will be located in your project's `target` directory:
        *   Debug: `target/debug/deps/[your_crate_name].jar`
        *   Release: `target/release/deps/[your_crate_name].jar`
    *   If your crate is a binary (`[[bin]]` or `src/main.rs`), run it using the `java` command:
        ```bash
        java -jar target/jvm-unknown-unknown/debug/[your_crate_name].jar
        ```

## Running This Project's Tests

This project includes integration tests managed by a Python script.

1.  **Ensure Toolchain is Built:** Build the project using `make all`. If you've changed the path of the repository, run `make gen-files` to regenerate the configuration files.
2.  **Run the Tester:**
    ```bash
    python3 Tester.py
    # For release mode tests:
    # python3 Tester.py --release
    ```
3.  **Check Output:** Look for the final "âœ… All tests passed!" message. If tests fail, the script will generate `.generated` files in the respective test directories (`tests/binary/*`) containing error details or output diffs.
